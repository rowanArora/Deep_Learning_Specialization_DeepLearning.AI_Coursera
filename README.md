# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Setup

Run ```setup.sh``` to (i) download a pre-trained VGG-19 dataset and (ii) extract the zip'd pre-trained models and datasets that are needed for all the assignments.

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.

## 2023 Version

As of July 2023, I have completed the first two courses of this specialization and am currently in the midst of completeing the other three courses which is why I don't have any work to show for the final three courses.

## Disclaimer

I recognize the time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
