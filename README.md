## Disclaimer

I recognize the time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
